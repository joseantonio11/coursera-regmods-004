Relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon
========================================================

## Summary
The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

We are interested in two question: "Is an automatic or manual transmission better for Mpg?" and "Quantifying how different is the Mpg between automatic and manual transmissions?" 
After the data analysis I can say there is a significant relationship between the fuel consumption and the transmission type so the manual transmission is better for Mpg. 
After experimenting with linear models I found that third model describes Mpg variable the best.

### Calculating the mean of each transmission types

```{r}
data(mtcars)
automean<-mean(mtcars$mpg[mtcars$am=="0"])
manualmean<-mean(mtcars$mpg[mtcars$am=="1"])
```
The mean for manual transmission is `r manualmean` Mpg and `r automean` Mpg for automatic transmission. This is a significant difference in the means. Manual transmissions have a higher value so based on mean of Mpg it is better (cheaper) to have manual 
transmission.

### Regression model of transmission type affecting the car's fuel consumption

Let's make a simple linear regression model with Mpg as depending variable and am as explanatory variable. We get following model: 
Mpg = 17.147 + 7.245 * am. Since manual transmission is denoted with am = 1, we can conclude that we can make more Mpg with manual 
transmission.

See the boxplot as fig 1 for visual explanation.
```{r}
fit1 <- lm(mpg~am, data=mtcars)
summary(fit1)
```

### Finding the best model

Let's fit a model with all explanatory variables. R-squared = 0.869
```{r}
fitAll<-lm(mpg~.,mtcars)
summary(fitAll)
```

P values are high so we can use only those variables with low p values, for example p, wt, qsec and am. Actually, we got 0.8579 R-squared for model lm(mpg~hp+wt+qsec+am,mtcars) which is lower than fitAll model, but with a little experimenting, I got the following model with 0.8942 R-squared:
```{r}
fit2<-lm(mpg~hp*wt+qsec+am,mtcars)
summary(fit2)
```

### Comparing models

We got 2 models, second one combining variables describes Mpg the best.

See fig 2 and 3 for visual explanation.
```{r}
anova(fit1, fit2)

```

P value is lower than 0.05 which means that model fit2 is significant improvement over model fit1
